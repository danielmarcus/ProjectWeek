## Key Investigators

- Dan Marcus (WashU)
- Kate Alpert (Radiologics)

# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->
XNAT 1.8 will be relased December 20 with an updated viewer built on OHIF 2.0. It includes workflows to create and store contours and segments as DICOM RT Struct and SegObject, respectively. 
But... additional improvements are needed to support more sophisticated visualizaiton and annotation workflows. 

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Objective A. Identify and implement pathways to improve performance, particularly when loading large DICOM series and seg objects
1. Objective B. Identify and implement data structures to capture annotations, including text and regions.
1. Objective C. Identify and implement storage of annotations in XNAT
